## ðŸ“˜ Included Programs

### 1. Prime Numbers from 1 to 100
**Filename:** `prime_numbers.c`  
**Description:** Prints all prime numbers between 1 and 100 using basic loops and divisibility logic.

### 2. Print Characters After First in a String
**Filename:** `print_after_first_char.c`  
**Description:** Demonstrates pointer manipulation and how embedded null characters in a string affect output; skips the first character and prints the rest.

### 3. Find Smallest, Largest, and Average Number
**Filename:** `min_max_avg.c`  
**Description:** Takes a set of numbers as input and computes the smallest, largest, and average value among them.

### 4. Nested Structure
**Filename:** `nested_structure.c`  
**Description:** Demonstrates how to declare and use nested structures in C for organizing complex data.

### 5. Pointer String Skip
**Filename:** `pointer_string_skip.c`  
**Description:** Uses pointer arithmetic to iterate through and selectively print characters from a string.

### 6. Power Using Recursion
**Filename:** `power_recursion.c`  
**Description:** Calculates the power of a number using a recursive function, i.e., computes `base^exponent`.

## ðŸš€ How to Compile and Run

You can compile any program using a C compiler like `gcc`:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output_name
./output_name
