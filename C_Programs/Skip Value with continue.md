## 📄 Description

This program demonstrates the use of the `continue` statement within a `do-while` loop. It prints numbers from `0` to `9`, skipping the value `7`.

When the loop reaches `j == 7`, the `continue` statement causes the rest of the loop body to be skipped for that iteration, and the loop proceeds to the next value.

### 🔍 Output

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9

Note that the number **7** is skipped in the output.
